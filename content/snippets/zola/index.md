## Context
In case you weren't aware, this whole site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
It's a fast, static site generator written in Rust. I left Hugo for it ðŸ’”

Also, shoutout to the theme creator, [Daudix](https://codeberg.org/daudix/duckquill) for making this theme.
He doesn't seem like a GitHub fan, so I didn't find much on deploying to Pages in his otherwise very comprehensive docs.


## Prerequisites
You should be able to find plenty of up-to-date resources for setting up GitHub pages and GitHub actions elsewhere.
I won't create any unnecessary surface area for breaking changes. I'll leave you to find those.

## Deployment
**In a nutshell, you can either:**

1. Push the workflow from the repo
2. Add it directly to the repo from GitHub Actions. 

{% alert(caution=true) %}
Make sure you update the Zola URL and version as needed, and keep an eye out for deprecation warnings. Most of this should be pretty easy to debug from the **GitHub Actions** UI.
