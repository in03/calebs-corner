## Hey! 👋 My name's Caleb

**Looks like you've found my little corner of cyberspace 💫**

![Any chance this is AI generated?](spaceme2.webp)

I'm currently based in [Brisbane, Queensland, Australia](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=brisbane+queensland+australia&t=vivaldi&atb=v389-1&iaxm=directions&end=Brisbane&transport=walking).

**I'm a:**

- 👨 Dad
- 👫 Husband
- ✝  Son
- 🤓 IT Professional
- 💾 Software Developer
- 🔐 Cybersecurity Student
- 📽 Video Veteran
- 🎶 Musician
- ✍ Writer

### By day, I work as an *IT Desktop Systems Engineer*

I work in education. As part of a close-knit team, I trade hats in technical support (walk-ins, onsite and remote), but officially I **Manage Company Endpoints**.
(I'm not allowed to use the term SOE anymore 😅).

When there's time, I like to develop automation workflows to *Work Smarter Not Harder* and make custom processes *easier*.

My close friendship with the system administrator at work affords me the luxury of tinkering with an enterprise grade Proxmox cluster 👨‍🏭.
Inevitably, Linux, Docker, LXC, VMs, ZFS and high availability are conversational staples. Likely you'll see some related ramblings here!

### By night, I work on projects

Here are some of the things I'm interested in working on:

👐 **Open-source** 
- I'm passionate about open-source. 
- I contribute where I can and maintain some popular-ish open-source projects myself.

🐧 **Linux** 
- I've been a Linux enthusiast since 2009
- I first installed *Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope* inspired by my Dad's 90's guide to RedHat Linux.

🐍 **Software Dev**
- Long-time [Python](https://www.python.org) programmer
- Enjoy PowerShell more than I was expecting to 😬
- Know enough Javascript and webdev to be dangerous 🚧
- Going headstrong into [Go](https://go.dev) is probably a good next step 
- Keen to get more into functional programming ([Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Gleam](https://gleam.run))
- Have a healthy fear of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) 🦀
- Long-time [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) listener 🎙


☁ **Self-hosting** 
- I'm a long-time homelabber! 
- Started with a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB
- Use Proxmox, Ubuntu, DietPi, TrueNAS, Ansible
- Proxmox on: `Ryzen 5 5500 + 24TiB ZFS ZRAID2 + ancient (literally rusty) GTX 680` living on my kitchen fridge
- DietPi on: `Raspberry Pi 4GB + MergerFS + Crucial MX500 SSDs`
- Docker, LXC, VMs
- I also have a fleet of various Raspberry Pi's
- I ♥ Cloudflare & Tailscale.

⚡ **Workflow automation** 
- I love working on tooling to automate workflows.
- My love for automation started with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
- Especially robust, long runnin-tasks
- Performant distributed computing makes me happy (when it works) ⚡

📡 **Decentralised Comms:** 
- [LoRa is awesome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa)! I have some cheeky TTGO T-Beam LoRa capable radios
- I enjoy hacking on mesh-networking with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org)
- A fellow mesher and I established a 24KM LOS link between two nodes!

🤖 **AI:**
- I am fascinated by AI 👀
- I'm excited by the prospects of automation flexibility using AI
- WIth my background in film, I love the development of generative AI in creative arts!
- I've enoyed implementing cutting-edge AI solutions with LangChain, Flowise and GPTScript.
