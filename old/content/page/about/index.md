# Hi! 👋 My name's Caleb. 

**Welcome to my little corner of Cyberspace 💫**

This is where I blog about my various projects, tinkerings and thoughts in technology – and some other stuff too!

In short, the musings of a **Battle Hardened Tech Noob 🤓💥**

![I guess this is what Cyberspace looks like?](spaceme1.webp)

## Why am I blogging?

My hope is that it will allow me to [learn better](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), teach better and find like-minded lads and lassies to collaborate with.

If I learn it and I like it, I'll try to write about it here.

## Who am I?

I'm Caleb Trevatt.

- I was born in [Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 🐨](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=brisbane+queensland+australia&t=vivaldi&atb=v389-1&iaxm=directions&end=Brisbane&transport=walking).
- I grew up in [Bali, Indonesia 🇮🇩](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bali&t=vivaldi&atb=v389-1&iaxm=directions&end=Bali&transport=walking).
- I'm now based back [Down Under 🦘](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=brisbane+queensland+australia&t=vivaldi&atb=v389-1&iaxm=directions&end=Brisbane&transport=walking).

I'm a son, husband and father. ✝👨‍👨‍👦

I'm also a [Software Developer](https://github.com/in03) 💾, [Cybersecurity Student](https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/certificate-iv-in-cyber-security-22603vic) 🔐, [Video Veteran](https://vimeo.com/trevattpictures) 📽, [Musician](https://soundcloud.com/in03) 🎶 and [Writer](/archives) ✍  

### By Day 🌅

I work as a **Desktop Systems Engineer**. I manage endpoint configuration and software deployments for the education sector.
As part of a close-knit team, I also trade hats in technical support (walk-ins, onsite and remote)

When there's time, I like to develop automation workflows to make life easier.

My tools of the trade include Proxmox, Python, PowerShell, Intune, Linux, Docker, LXCs, VMs, ZFS and the like.

### By Night 🌙

As a time poor Dad, I've had little to show for my free time over the last few years...
Recently, I've found inspiration to work on stuff again ✨

**Stuff like...**

- I've been a Linux enthusiast since 2009
- I first installed *[Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-September/000481.html)* inspired by my Dad's 90's guide to RedHat Linux.
- I mainly did it to squeeze out more performance from my *Compaq Potato* first computer.
