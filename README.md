***My humble blog*** ðŸ˜Œ

After many moons running Hugo, I got frustrated with fragile build issues, slow image handling and deprecations and decided to experiment with Zola again.

The theme is [DuckQuill](https://www.getzola.org/themes/duckquill/) made by the very capable [David Lapshin](https://daudix.one/). Thanks David!
